<p>My favourite story is The Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Not because it's so fun to read, Tolkien wasn't a great writer. Neither because it's the best story in the world; Steven Erikson's Malazan books are much better.</p>
<p>But the world building is so immersive, the tiny details from page-long family trees to complete conlangs <small>(constructed languages)</small><!-- smaller text in a new tag -->, from the habits of the Hobbits to the scenery descriptions, the time and thoughts and love Tolkien invested into writing Christian legends that were also bedtime stories for his children, they all make up for the lack of writing abilities of a language professor.</p>
